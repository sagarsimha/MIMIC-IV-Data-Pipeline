# MIMIC-IV Multimodal Pipeline
![MIMIC overview](images_v2/mimic_multimodal.png)

**MIMIC-IV data pipeline** is an end-to-end pipeline that offers a configurable framework to prepare MIMIC-IV data for the downstream tasks. 
The pipeline cleans the raw data by removing outliers and allowing users to impute missing entries. 
It also provides options for the clinical grouping of medical features using standard coding systems for dimensionality reduction.  
All of these options are customizable for the users, allowing them to generate a personalized  patient cohort. 
The customization steps can be recorded for the reproducibility of the overall framework. 
The pipeline produces a smooth time-series dataset by binning the sequential data into equal-length time intervals and allowing for filtering of the time-series length according to the user's preferences.
Besides the data processing modules, our pipeline also includes two additional modules for modeling and evaluation. 
For modeling, the pipeline includes several commonly used sequential models for performing prediction tasks. 
The evaluation module offers a series of standard methods for evaluating the performance of the created models. 
This module also includes options for reporting individual and group fairness measures.

**MIMIC-IV Multimodal Pipeline**
A MIMIC IV multimodal pipeline integrating multiple modalities, including structured data (e.g., vitals, labs, medications), unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports), waveforms (e.g., electrocardiogram signals), and imaging data (e.g., chest X-rays, echocardiograms). While each modality has been individually leveraged in prior research, these modalities remain disjointed in their storage and access, requiring extensive manual effort to preprocess and align them for downstream analysis. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive and customizable multimodal data processing pipeline for MIMIC-IV that systematically integrates five modalities.
